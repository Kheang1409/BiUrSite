## Docker Setup

This project uses **Docker** to simplify setup and deployment. The services required for the application are defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

### Services:
- **sql_server_container**: A SQL Server container that stores the application's data.
- **backend**: The .NET API backend, which interacts with the SQL Server.
- **frontend**: The Angular frontend that communicates with the backend API.

### Setting Up Docker

Ensure that **Docker** and **Docker Compose** are installed on your machine.

- Build and start the services:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This command will:
- Build the Docker images for the backend and frontend.
- Start the SQL Server container.
- Start the backend and frontend services.

### Accessing the Application
- **Frontend**: Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
- **Backend API**: The backend API will be available at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

---

## Database Setup:
The database is automatically created and configured by the SQL Server container. The backend will connect to the database using the connection string defined in the Docker Compose file.
